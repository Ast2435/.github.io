      <h2>Important milestones in Albert's hofmann life</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>In <b>1914</b>, he was born in Baden, Switzerland.</li>
        <li>In <b>1929</b>, he finished his chemistry degree at the University of ZÃ¼rich.</li>
        <li>In <b>1929</b>, he got his doctorate for researching the chemical structure of the animal sustance 'chitin'.</li>
        <li>In <b>1938</b>, Hofmann first synthetized LSD while researching medicinal uses for plants.</li>
        <li>It was not until <b>16 April 1943</b> when Hofmann accidentally absorbed a small amount of the drug trough his fingers, when he discovered the psicodelic properties of the substance.</li>
        <li><b>Three days later</b>, like any scientist would have done, he ingested a dose of 250 micrograms of LSD for further experimentation, this day is known as "Bycicle day" and was the first intentional trip ever.</li>
        <li>In <b>1958</b>, he synthesized multiple hallucinogenic tryptamines, this led to the synthesis of psilocybin, the active agent found in "magic mushrooms".</li>
        <li>In <b>2016</b>, in an interview, he called LSD the "medicine of the soul" and was frustrated by the worldwide prohibition of it, he conceded that it could be dangerous if misused, but still had a tremendous potential for psychoanalisis and mental
          health solutions.</li>
        <li>In <b>2018</b>, he died surrounded by several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</li>
